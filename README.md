## Overview of Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis involves analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is a critical component of forecasting and prediction in domains such as finance, weather forecasting, and supply chain management.

### Key Components of Time Series:

1. **Trend**: Long-term movement in the data.
2. **Seasonality**: Patterns that repeat over a fixed period.
3. **Cyclic**: Fluctuations with no fixed frequency.
4. **Noise**: Random variations in the data.

## Tools and Techniques

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization of data trends, seasonality, and noise using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Statistical summaries to understand the data's behavior over time.

### 2. **Data Preparation**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Smoothing and detrending data.
   - Transformations (e.g., log, differencing) to stabilize variance.

### 3. **Forecasting Models**

#### AR (Auto-Regressive) Model:
Captures the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.

#### MA (Moving Average) Model:
Models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

#### ARMA (Auto-Regressive Moving Average) Model:
Combines AR and MA models for better accuracy.

#### ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Model:
Adds differencing to the ARMA model to make the data stationary.

#### SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model:
Extends ARIMA to include seasonality.

#### Prophet:
Developed by Facebook, this model is robust to missing data, outliers, and seasonal patterns.

## Sample Dataset

![Dataset Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/table.png)  
The repository includes the **international-airline-passengers.csv** dataset, a classic example for time series analysis.

| Month      | Passengers |
|------------|------------|
| 1949-01    | 112        |
| 1949-02    | 118        |
| 1949-03    | 132        |
| ...        | ...        |

## Visualization Examples

### Seasonal Decomposition
![Seasonal Decomposition Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/statistics.png)  
Decompose time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
result = seasonal_decompose(data['Passengers'], model='additive')
result.plot();
```

### Forecasting with ARIMA
![ARIMA Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/000000/line-chart.png)  
Implement ARIMA for predictive modeling:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
model = ARIMA(data['Passengers'], order=(5,1,0))
model_fit = model.fit()
print(model_fit.summary())
```
